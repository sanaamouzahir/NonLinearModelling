# NonLinearModelling
The goal of this project is to model the propagation of fracture inside ice sheets in Antarctica. The first part considers the non linear material without any damage, the second part incorporates the damage Maxwell's model, with the use of a convoluted semi analytical integration scheme. 
In this work, we also analyze the effect of the introduction of mechanical imperfections in the system, in both the damaged and non damaged states. Finally, we study the phenomenon of energy dissipation and thermodynamic consistency.
